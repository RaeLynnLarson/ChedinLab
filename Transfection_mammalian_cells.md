[^-1] possitive control is for testing the the enzymes are working as intended. Negative control is for making forsure that the cell isn't being transfected with any old RNA 
##Prep: prepare siRNA in 1x buffer (RNase-free). Prep/dilute DharmaFECT reagents for the desired cell line 
### taylsa enjoys 1 to 1.5 micrograms of plasmid per a transfection.
