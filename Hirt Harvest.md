# Hirt Harvest 
### For R-loops do not vortex or heat 
### Use 3mL Hirt buffer for 100 mm dishes
## Stuff needed 
- [ ] Hirt buffer: 2.91 ml Hirt and 90 uL 20% SDS
- [ ] 0.01 M Tris
- [ ] 0.01 M EDTA
- [ ] 5M NaCl
- [ ] phenol 
- [ ] chloroform
- [ ] 3M Na-acetate, pH 7 
- [ ] 100% EtOH
- [ ] npH20 
- [ ] transfected cells 

## proceedure
- [ ] harvest cells (trysinize, pipetting), spin down at 400xg for 8 min. Wash with 3mL of 1x PBS and spin again. Resuspend cells in Hirt buffer without SDS. 
- [ ] Once cells are suspended, add SDS and lyse cells. Mixure should turn clear and goopy at this point as cells are gently inverted. 
- [ ] add 1/4 vol (750 uL) of 5M NaCl and invert 10-20 times. Let stant in 4 C at least overnight (more like two or three days if you can). 
- [ ] spin at 8000 rpm, at 4 C, for 30 min in fixed angle rotor (sovall centrifuge)
- [ ] phenol extraction: in the lab hood, add 3 mL buffer-saturated phenol. Mix via inversting until uniform. Spin for 10 min at 5000 rpm (RT). Recover top aquous layer in clean tube 
- [ ] Chloroform extraction: in the lab hood, add 3 mL of chloroform. Mix several times via inversion. spin for 5 min at 5000 rpm (RT) and then recover top aquous layer.
- [ ] Ethanol precipitate: add 1/10 volume (~300 uL) of Na-Acetate and 2.5 volume (~7 mL) 100% EtOH. Invert a few times and incubate at -20 for more than 30 min 
- [ ] Spin cells down at 8k rpm, 4 C, for 30 min in a Sorvall centrifuge. Carefully pour off supernatant, and rise with 2mL 705 EtOH. Spin again at 6k rpm for 5min, and carefully pour off supernatant. Air dry pellet/55 C oven until dry 
- [ ] Resuspend pellet in 75 uL TE
