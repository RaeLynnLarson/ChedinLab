#### I need to make more of just about everything, including the pFC9. (Electroporation)

## plasmids used 
| Plasmid | OD260 in ng/ul on 4/26| amount needed for a 50 ng chemoporation |
|--------|--------|-------|
| pFC19 | 211.5 | 0.24 ul |
| pFC30 | 1065 | 0.047 ul |
| pFC61 | 302.2 | 0.16 ul |
| pFC66 | 150 | 0.33 ul |
| pFC9 | 312.2 | 0.16 ul |

## steps
- [ ] thaw 5 0.5 mL vials of stock chemical-compentent cells on ice for 10 min 
- [ ] add 50 ng of DNA to cells. Mix via careful inversion 
- [ ] place mixure on ice for 30 min 
- [ ] heat at 42 degrees C for 30 sec and then place on ice for 5 min. No mixing 
- [ ] add 300 uL of LB (no amp) to vials and mix 
- [ ] place at 37 degrees for 60 min with mixing. Warm selection plates at 37 degrees 
- [ ] rescue cells and mix them thorogly. plate 1/2 (250 uL) the vial onto each plate and leave over night.

#### Notes (4/26): plasmids pFC19, pFC30, pFC61 and pFC9 all had to be dilluted 10x in order to be in usuable concentrations. Cells were definentatly on ice for too long. IMPORTANT: I forgot to label the cell vials before putting them on ice, so I will have to decypher who is who on the gel.
