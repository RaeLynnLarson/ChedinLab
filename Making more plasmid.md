#### I need to make more of just about everything, including the pFC9. (Electroporation)

## plasmids used 
| Plasmid | OD260 in ng/ul on 4/26| amount needed for a 50 ng chemoporation |
|--------|--------|-------|
| pFC19 | 211.5 | 0.24 ul |
| pFC30 | 1065 | 0.047 ul |
| pFC61 | 302.2 | 0.16 ul |
| pFC66 | 150 | 0.33 ul |
| pFC9 | 312.2 | 0.16 ul |

## steps
- [ ] thaw 5 0.5 mL vials of stock chemical-compentent cells on ice for 10 min 
- [ ] add 50 ng of DNA to cells. Mix via careful inversion 
- [ ] place mixure on ice for 30 min 
- [ ] heat at 42 degrees C for 30 sec and then place on ice for 5 min. No mixing 
- [ ] add 300 uL of LB (no amp) to vials and mix 
- [ ] place at 37 degrees for 60 min with mixing. Warm selection plates at 37 degrees 
- [ ] rescue cells and mix them thorogly. plate 1/2 (250 uL) the vial onto each plate and leave over night.

#### Notes (4/26): plasmids pFC19, pFC30, pFC61 and pFC9 all had to be dilluted 10x in order to be in usuable concentrations. Cells were definentatly on ice for too long. IMPORTANT: I forgot to label the cell vials before putting them on ice, so I will have to decypher who is who on the gel.

#### Checked on colonies. All colonies show transfection but two show worse confluency than others. Don't know which two because I mixed up the labels yesterday. I will have to carefully plan a restriction gel in order to ID the genes correctly. 
#### All plasmid colonies will be allowed to grow overnight in 150 mL of 100 ug/ml of LB. Plasmid midiprep will happen tomorrow.

#### plasmid midiprep
## steps: 
- [ ] transfer culture to centrifugable tubes and spin cells down at 6k rpn for 6 min. Discard supernatant 
- [ ] add 4 mLs of solution I and resuspend pellets in it via vortexing. Let rest at RT for 5 to 10 min 
- [ ] add 8 mL of solution II and mix via inversion 4-6 times. place tubes on ice and vortex for 5 min
- [ ] add 6 mL of solution III and mix via inversion 4-6 times. Incubate on ice for 10 min. 
- [ ] centrifuge cells for 10 min at 10k rpm at 4 degrees celcius 
- [ ] transfer supernant to new tube and add 1 vol isopropanol 100% and mix 
- [ ] recentrifuge for 10 min at 14k rpm for at 4 degrees celcius. Discard supernatant and wash pellet in 5 mL 70% EtOH. Note: if you wish, you can repeat this step twice or thrice. Just be careful about the pelet at the bottom and do not disturb it. 
- [ ] Dry pellet (in 55 degree C oven is fine) and resuspend in TE
- [ ] Gel and RNase digest (5 uL of stock into each tube)
 
 #### issues: someone turned off the spiny thing in the 37 degree room. It only affected colony three, which later on the gel showed a lesser concentration. 
 ## 5-3-22 Gel, RNase A treatment, and LiCl prep

*Note: image above shows that there is a lot of crap in the DNA. This was before the RNAseA treatment and the phenol chloroform treatment. Hopefully this solves the crap problem. Idk about vials 2 and 4, they seem pretty milky to me and I am wondering if I should just gel the whole batch if they don't respond well to the treatments* 
#### RNaseA treatment: 
- 5 uL of RNAse A was added to each vial on 5/2. Then after 1 hour sitting at RT, they were refrozen. 
#### LiCl
- Added step: there was still some crap in the vials so I spun it down in the centrifuge for 15 min on 14K rpm and skimmed off the supernatant. 
- Add  1 ml of 10M LiCl, mix by inverting 4-6 times.
- Incubate for >= 20min. at -20°C.
- Centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 10 min at 4°C.
- Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.
- Add 2.2 volume of ethanol 100%; mix by inverting.
- Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C.
- Wash twice with 70% ethanol.
- Dry the pellet and dissolve in 500µl of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5.
