HEK 293 cells
## derived from the immortalised cells of aborted/miscarried human embryonic kidneys. Stabilized via repeated cloning and viral genome incorperation of adenovirus (4.5 kb insertion from left arm of viral genome into chr 19). Orgin of HEK cell is unclear, most likly an immature neruon or epithelial cell (hard to tell because of the adenovirus addition)  
## known to be good with transfection (introduction of foreign DNA into mammalian cells). 
[^1] this is not transformation, which referes to the uptake of genetic material from the suroundings of plant, yeast or bacterial 
## geneome is weird. Exhibits a phenomena called hypotriploid: contains fewer than three chromosomes 
###(Bylund, L., Kytölä, S., Lui, W. O., Larsson, C., & Weber, G. (2004). Analysis of the cytogenetic stability of the human embryonal kidney cell line 293 by cytogenetic and STR profiling approaches. Cytogenetic and genome research, 106(1), 28-32.). Used STRs to establish which chr are aborant. Colonal varition can happen.
##application: grown in suspension cultures. Can be used for transfection (best method was told to be Ca++ K+ processing) or adenoviral vector propagation. 
Cell culture basics: 
##freezing cells: label vial (type, passage and date) and prechilled freezing medium with cold pack. De-attach cells (if nessisary) and figure out how much freezing medium is needed via cell number and conc (should be cell+medium specific). After centriguging cells and discarding warm medium, resuspent cells in freezing medium (slow and gentle). put cells in freezing vial and use slow regulated freezing (-1 degree per a minute until -80). put them in the freezer
## prep: prewarm medium and cell culture flask. Get cells out of N2l and place in dry ice. thaw in 37 C bath without submerging until nearly all thawed. Clean the vial. 
## cell prep: add cells and 10 mL of pre-warmed medium to centrifuge tube. Avoid osmotic shock by gently acclimating cells to medium. spin 'em with the correct proceedure for the cell type. Discard supernant without diserbing pellet. Add 10 mL warm medium and resuspend cells. put them on growing dish and coat surface evenly and gently via rocking. allow to grow for a few days checking periodically
[^1] incubator should be set to 37 degrees, 5 to 7% CO2 and high humidity. Cells need air so don't suffocate your plates 
[^1] plz don't over warm medium. Taylsa warms for around 30 min after making for sure bath is sertile and lid is not touching media 
## aseptic tenque: wash everything with 70% ethanol before and after entering the hood. Nothing goes in and out of the hood once the cells are out except for the tip of sterile pipets as they are passed in and out of the area. Do not touch the inside of the cap or bottle of the mediums with pipette or fingers, and NO NOT REUSE PIPETTES! set cap interior surface down and label bottle after supplimentation. Spills must be wiped with EtOH immediatly. Do not cross over a flask to prevent cross contamination. Tightly close everything and wipe down everything with 70% EtOH before leaving 
## cell passaging: cells grow logirthmically until they hit the max cell density for the plate; passaging should happen near when max density is reached. find culture and look for any signs of trouble. Remove the left over medium, and wash adhered cells in salt solution (NO Ca+ or Mg+), then remove and add cell disocciation fluid. use centrfugation to remove disossociation fluid 
##[^1]: cells are very delicate at this stage. please handle with care and keep them under liquid as much as possible. double check for both association to the plate and dissassication. Different dissociation serums have different strength and needs, so read the one your using and use something gentle. 
##resuspend pellet in warm growth medium and prefom cell counting (if nessary), and get to optimal seeding density. add to flask (and allow for gas exchange) and evenly distribute cells for incubation.
