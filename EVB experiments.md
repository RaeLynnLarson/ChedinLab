## Background 
#### EBV is a viral vector that can get into and replicate in mammalian cells. We will be using it to transfect a number of cells with R-loop prone plasmids an see how, and where they form R loops 
#### R-loops can get into chromatin and make R-loops as long as it is in the correct orientation (Chedin. 2012). 
#### We are going to use HEKI 293c18 cells. These are resistant to both Amp and Hygromycin and so we will use 200 ng/ml hydromycin buffer to grow out cells in 
#### After cells are transfected with plasmids, will will use Hirt Harvetro to harvest DNA 
####  After that, SMRF seq can be used to determine location of R-loops 
#Prep of materials 
##plasmids used 
| Plasmid | OD260 in ng/ul| 
|--------|--------|
| pFC19 | 385.8 |
| pFC30 | 1000 | 
| pFC61 | 277.9 |
| pFC66 | 106 | 
### plasmids were OD260nm'ed and the results are shown above. 
### Samples where then digeted with 0.5 ul ECORi and 1 ul 2.1 NEB buffer for >20 min at 37 C. After that the samples were gel electrophoresised in 0.8x gel at 70 V for > 30 min. 1 kb ladder was provided

*Note: the image above shows no smear on the bands, showing little to no DNA degredation during storage. This is important because this DNA was quite old (~20 yrs) and was in cold storage. The first vial (second lane) shows less product than the rest of the lanes. This has been chalked up to sampling error due to the age of the DNA.* 
###Plasmids were shown to be in good condition. Next steps include preparing and transfecting the cells.
