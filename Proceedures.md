## Making more DMEM (6/29/22 Chedin lab) 
-DMEM, P/S, L-glut, and FBS are all needed 
-DMEM can be found in 500 mL bottles in the downstairs cold rooms. 
-Before use, 5 mL of P/S and 5 mL of L-Glut from the -20 must be added, and 50 mL FBS from the -80 
## Making Chemically compotent cells

## LiCl
- Added step: there was still some crap in the vials so I spun it down in the centrifuge for 15 min on 14K rpm and skimmed off the supernatant. 
- Add  1 ml of 10M LiCl, mix by inverting 4-6 times.
- Incubate for >= 20min. at -20°C.
- Centrifuge at 14,000rpm for 10 min at 4°C.
- Transfer the supernatant to a clean tube.
- Add 2.2 volume of ethanol 100%; mix by inverting.
- Centrifuge at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C.
- Wash twice with 70% ethanol.
- Dry the pellet and dissolve in 500µl of 10 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5 or TE
## Phenol Chloroform extraction 
- wear full PPE and use fume hood when using phenol! Make the sample volume around 200 uL for easy pipetting
- adjust sample volume to 200 uL and pro K digest if nessisary 
- get yello grease tubes from cabnet. Label and add sample to them. 
- add a 1 to 1 dilution of phenol in the hood 
[^1]: phenol is stored in a bilayer so it doesn't evaporate too much. Please take the phenol from the bottom layer of the stock solution in the 4 degree fridge
- once phenol and sample are together, invert 4 to 6 x and spin at 12 k for 5 min 
- EtOH precip to concentrate DNA 
## EtOH precip
- Transfer the supernatant to a new tube; add 2.2x V of 100% EtOH + 0.1x V NaAcetate and + 2 uL of glycogen; mix by inversion.
- put samples in -20 fridge for 1 hour or -80 for 30 min. They can be left in the fridge over night 
- Centrifuge for 30 min. at max speed at 4°C.
- Discard supernatant.  Wash the pellets with 500 µl  of 70% ethanol.
- Dry the pellets and dissolve the DNA in 50-100µl of TE, as desired.
## Hirt Harvest 
### !For R-loops do not vortex or heat!
### Use 3mL Hirt buffer for 100 mm dishes
## Stuff needed 
- [ ] Hirt buffer: 2.91 ml Hirt and 90 uL 20% SDS
- [ ] 0.01 M Tris
- [ ] 0.01 M EDTA
- [ ] 5M NaCl
- [ ] phenol 
- [ ] chloroform
- [ ] 3M Na-acetate, pH 7 
- [ ] 100% EtOH
- [ ] npH20 
- [ ] transfected cells 

## proceedure
- [ ] harvest cells (trysinize, pipetting), spin down at 400xg for 8 min. Wash with 3mL of 1x PBS and spin again. Resuspend cells in Hirt buffer without SDS. 
- [ ] Once cells are suspended, add SDS and lyse cells. Mixure should turn clear and goopy at this point as cells are gently inverted. 
- [ ] add 1/4 vol (750 uL) of 5M NaCl and invert 10-20 times. Let stant in 4 C at least overnight (more like two or three days if you can). 
- [ ] spin at 8000 rpm, at 4 C, for 30 min in fixed angle rotor (sovall centrifuge)
- [ ] phenol extraction: in the lab hood, add 3 mL buffer-saturated phenol. Mix via inversting until uniform. Spin for 10 min at 5000 rpm (RT). Recover top aquous layer in clean tube 
- [ ] Chloroform extraction: in the lab hood, add 3 mL of chloroform. Mix several times via inversion. spin for 5 min at 5000 rpm (RT) and then recover top aquous layer.
- [ ] Ethanol precipitate: add 1/10 volume (~300 uL) of Na-Acetate and 2.5 volume (~7 mL) 100% EtOH. Invert a few times and incubate at -20 for more than 30 min 
- [ ] Spin cells down at 8k rpm, 4 C, for 30 min in a Sorvall centrifuge. Carefully pour off supernatant, and rise with 2mL 705 EtOH. Spin again at 6k rpm for 5min, and carefully pour off supernatant. Air dry pellet/55 C oven until dry 
- [ ] Resuspend pellet in 75 uL TE
