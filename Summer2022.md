#Stuff that needs to get done
- [ ] thaw cells 
- prep: prewarm medium and cell culture flask (30 min). Get cells out of N2l and place in dry ice [^1] . thaw in 37 C [^2] bath without submerging until nearly all thawed. Clean the vial. 
 [^1]: remeber to record the passage number, date, and name of the cell on both the N2 container and in your personal notes. 
- cell prep: add cells and 10 mL of pre-warmed medium (as little as possible to maintain cell suspension) to centrifuge tube. Avoid osmotic shock by gently acclimating cells to medium. spin 'em with the correct proceedure for the cell type. Discard supernant without diserbing pellet.
- Add 10 mL warm medium and resuspend cells. put them on growing dish and coat surface evenly and gently via rocking. allow to grow for a few days checking periodically 
[^2]: plz don't over warm medium. Taylsa warms for around 30 min after making for sure bath is sertile and lid is not touching media 
- aseptic tenque: wash everything with 70% ethanol before and after entering the hood. Nothing goes in and out of the hood once the cells are out except for the tip of sterile pipets as they are passed in and out of the area. Do not touch the inside of the cap or bottle of the mediums with pipette or fingers, and NO NOT REUSE PIPETTES! set cap interior surface down and label bottle after supplimentation. Spills must be wiped with EtOH immediatly. Do not cross over a flask to prevent cross contamination. Tightly close everything and wipe down everything with 70% EtOH before leaving 
- [ ] grow cells onto 7 plates
- cell passaging: cells grow logirthmically until they hit the max cell density for the plate; passaging should happen near when max density is reached. find culture and look for any signs of trouble [^3]. Remove the left over medium, and wash adhered cells in salt solution (NO Ca+ or Mg+), then remove and add cell disocciation fluid. use centrfugation to remove disossociation fluid 
[^3]: cells are very delicate at this stage. please handle with care and keep them under liquid as much as possible. double check for both association to the plate and dissassication. Different dissociation serums have different strength and needs, so read the one your using and use something gentle. 
- resuspend pellet in warm growth medium and prefom cell counting (if nessary), and get to optimal seeding density. add to flask (and allow for gas exchange) and evenly distribute cells for incubation.
- [ ] transfect 6 of those plates 
- ### Ingredients 
- 2 to 4 grams plamsid, including pFC19, pFC30, pFC61, pFC66, pFC9, and GFP 
-  6 (at least) 100 mm x 10 cm plates 
- lots of hygromycin (200 ug/mL) 
- serum-free growth media 
- DharmaFECT kb reagent 

### Steps: 
- dillute cells in 10 uL serum-free growth media
- gently mix DharmaFECT kb reagent via pipetting. Dilute reagent in 10 uL per plate serum-free growth media 
- Add 10 uL dilute reagent to 10 uL dilute DNA for 20 uL solution. Incubate this for 10 min at room temp 
- add 80 uL growth media to complex and mix 
- get cell culture plate (must be at 70-90% confluent) and aspriate media. Then add 100 uL of tranfection reagent:DNA complex 
- rock plate to acheive even distrubtion of complex across cells 
- after first 48 hr, add medium containing antibiotic (200 ug/mL) 
- Check cells every day or so to see if any GFP expression occured. This will be our indicator of tranfection efficacy. 

- [ ] Hirt harvest the DNA from those cells 
- [ ] SMRF sequencing
