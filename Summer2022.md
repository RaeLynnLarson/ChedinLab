# Stuff that needs to get done
- [ ] thaw cells 
- prep: prewarm medium and cell culture flask (30 min). Get cells out of N2l and place in dry ice [^1] . thaw in 37 C [^2] bath without submerging until nearly all thawed. Clean the vial. 
 [^1]: remember to record the passage number, date, and name of the cell on both the N2 container and in your personal notes. 
- cell prep: add cells and 10 mL of pre-warmed medium (as little as possible to maintain cell suspension) to centrifuge tube. Avoid osmotic shock by gently acclimating cells to medium. spin 'em with the correct proceedure for the cell type. Discard supernant without diserbing pellet.
- Add 10 mL warm medium and resuspend cells. put them on growing dish and coat surface evenly and gently via rocking. allow to grow for a few days checking periodically 
[^2]: plz don't over warm medium. Taylsa warms for around 30 min after making for sure bath is sertile and lid is not touching media 
- aseptic tenque: wash everything with 70% ethanol before and after entering the hood. Nothing goes in and out of the hood once the cells are out except for the tip of sterile pipets as they are passed in and out of the area. Do not touch the inside of the cap or bottle of the mediums with pipette or fingers, and NO NOT REUSE PIPETTES! set cap interior surface down and label bottle after supplimentation. Spills must be wiped with EtOH immediatly. Do not cross over a flask to prevent cross contamination. Tightly close everything and wipe down everything with 70% EtOH before leaving 
### 6-27-22: Taylsa did this first part today. Will split cells into 6 plate dish + 1 10 mL plate next on Wednesday. Supplies are in the downstairs cold room
- [ ] grow cells onto 7 plates
- cell passaging: cells grow logirthmically until they hit the max cell density for the plate; passaging should happen near when max density is reached. find culture and look for any signs of trouble [^3]. Remove the left over medium, and wash adhered cells in salt solution (NO Ca+ or Mg+), then remove and add cell disocciation fluid. use centrfugation to remove disossociation fluid 
[^3]: cells are very delicate at this stage. please handle with care and keep them under liquid as much as possible. double check for both association to the plate and dissassication. Different dissociation serums have different strength and needs, so read the one your using and use something gentle. 
- resuspend pellet in warm growth medium and prefom cell counting (if nessary), and get to optimal seeding density. add to flask (and allow for gas exchange) and evenly distribute cells for incubation.
 
- [ ] transfect 6 of those plates 
### 6-29-22: cells were passaged onto 6 six well plate and one 10 mL plate from p3 to p4. 0.5 mL of cells were plated on to a 10 mL plate for cell line maintanence and 250K cells into each of the six well one. Cell live count was 0.52E6 cells/mL, leading to the addition of 3.125 mL of solution of 10 mL of P/S free media, and 2 mL of that was added to each well. Cells were checked the next day where they were transfected. 

- ### Ingredients 
| Plate numeral | plasmid | conc [ng/ul] | needed amount = 2000/conc |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- | --------- |
| I | pFC9 (I) | (10x dil.) 440 | 4.54 |
| II | pFC19 (OG) | 217 | 9.21 |
| III | pFC30 (OG) | 800 | 2.5 |
| IV | pFC61 (V) | (10x dil.) 413 | 4.84 |
| V | pFC66 (II)| (10x dil.) 486 | 4.11 |
| VI | GFP | 1559 | 1.28 |

### Steps: 
- Cells should be grown in P/S free media to get best transfection
- Get two sets of 1.5 mL tubes, one for each plasmid and put 250 uL OptiMEM into it. 
- Add 1:1000 lipofectamine uL:TV mL of plate media of lipofectamine to one set of tubes, and 2k ng of plasmid in the other. Adjust OptiMEM amount in previous step in order to keep the total fluid added to the dishes to be no more than 0.5 mL
 
| Tube Ia | Tube Ib | Tube IIa | Tube IIb | Tube IIIa | Tube IIIb | Tube IVa | Tube IVb | Tube Va | Tube Vb | Tube VIa | Tube VIb | 
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| 243.55 uL OptiMEM + 4.45 uL DNA | 247 uL OptiMEM + 3 uL lipofect | 238.79 uL OptiMEM + 9.21 uL DNA | 247 uL OptiMEM + 3 uL lipofect | 245.5 uL OptiMEM + 2.5 uL DNA | 247 uL OptiMEM + 3 uL lipofect | 243.16 uL OptiMEM + 4.84 uL DNA | 247 uL OptiMEM + 3 uL lipofect | 243.3 uL OptiMEM + 4.11 uL DNA | 247 uL OptiMEM + 3 uL lipofect | 246.72 uL OptiMEM + 1.28 uL DNA | 247 uL OptiMEM + 3 uL lipofect |

- mix OptiMEM and ingredents 20x times and then incubate at RT for 5 min
- mix the tubes together and mix another 20x times (spin down if needed). Let rest at RT for 20 min 
- add mixture dropwise to the plates and incubate for 24 hours 
### 6/30/22 Today I transfected the cells with no major incedents. I will check on them tomorrow and the day after for tranfection efficency. If I see glowing GFP, then I will add 2.5 uL of 100 ug/mL hygromycin per a well. Fresh media will be supplied during the exchange 
### 7/4/22 Hygromycin happened two days ago (2.5 uL was added per a 2.5 mL well). Cell death was observed. Cells were then passaged onto p5 with 1 mL of tripsin per a well. Cell counting was attempted to be used but when plated cells were observed under a microscope only dead cells were truly observed. It took 1 mL of 4 mL cell suspension per a dish in order to observe at least one live cell in a dish. Images of GFP cell expression before passaging is on phone. p4 10 mL dish of cells had its media exchanged, but I don't think it needed it.

*Note: image above shows calculations of cell amount based on cell density. I know that then they were disregarded, but this is the only place I recorded the live cell density so I am saving it here*

### 7/6/22 Cells were grown in full media for 2 days and establishment did happen. After looking at GFP expression under microscope, it was decided to flush old media out of the wells, rinse with saline solution, and then be reselected for in hygromycin supplimented media. The 10 ml cells were passaged onto p5 today in full media. Images of GFP expression are shown below.

### 7/11/22 Taylsa checked my cells over the weekend and did not report anything suprising. The transfected cells didn't need any new media and GFP expression could still be seen (shown below). A cursory sweep shows very low transfection rates (around 1%). I will try a thrid hyrgromycin pass and then talk to Taylsa/Chedin about it. Non-transfected cells were passaged from p5 to p6.

### 7/13/22 Cells continue to grow. I washed out dead cells and old media with some saline and then reapplied new media + hygromycin (15 ml of DMEM + 15 uL of hygromycin with 1.5 mL of fluid per a well) Expression is still pressent but slight. Imegages taken before the wash shown below.

### 7/14/22 Cells look wonderful! Small clumpings of cells observed, and when observed for GFP expression it was shown that each clumping had lots of GFP expression. Pictures are shown below. The cell line was passaged from p6 to p7.

### Next steps are to grow the cell colonies up. After this media is used up by the cells we will switch back to normal DMEM to give them the best chance at growth. Once splitting is needed, we can put the cells on 10 mL dishes. Check with Chedin about date of Hirt harvest, and amount of cells needed.
