#Stuff that needs to get done
- [ ] thaw cells 
- prep: prewarm medium and cell culture flask (30 min). Get cells out of N2l and place in dry ice [^1] . thaw in 37 C [^2] bath without submerging until nearly all thawed. Clean the vial. 
 [^1]: remember to record the passage number, date, and name of the cell on both the N2 container and in your personal notes. 
- cell prep: add cells and 10 mL of pre-warmed medium (as little as possible to maintain cell suspension) to centrifuge tube. Avoid osmotic shock by gently acclimating cells to medium. spin 'em with the correct proceedure for the cell type. Discard supernant without diserbing pellet.
- Add 10 mL warm medium and resuspend cells. put them on growing dish and coat surface evenly and gently via rocking. allow to grow for a few days checking periodically 
[^2]: plz don't over warm medium. Taylsa warms for around 30 min after making for sure bath is sertile and lid is not touching media 
- aseptic tenque: wash everything with 70% ethanol before and after entering the hood. Nothing goes in and out of the hood once the cells are out except for the tip of sterile pipets as they are passed in and out of the area. Do not touch the inside of the cap or bottle of the mediums with pipette or fingers, and NO NOT REUSE PIPETTES! set cap interior surface down and label bottle after supplimentation. Spills must be wiped with EtOH immediatly. Do not cross over a flask to prevent cross contamination. Tightly close everything and wipe down everything with 70% EtOH before leaving 
- ### 6-27-22: Taylsa did this first part today. Will split cells into 6 plate dish + 1 10 mL plate next on Wednesday. Supplies are in the downstairs cold room
- [ ] grow cells onto 7 plates
- cell passaging: cells grow logirthmically until they hit the max cell density for the plate; passaging should happen near when max density is reached. find culture and look for any signs of trouble [^3]. Remove the left over medium, and wash adhered cells in salt solution (NO Ca+ or Mg+), then remove and add cell disocciation fluid. use centrfugation to remove disossociation fluid 
[^3]: cells are very delicate at this stage. please handle with care and keep them under liquid as much as possible. double check for both association to the plate and dissassication. Different dissociation serums have different strength and needs, so read the one your using and use something gentle. 
- resuspend pellet in warm growth medium and prefom cell counting (if nessary), and get to optimal seeding density. add to flask (and allow for gas exchange) and evenly distribute cells for incubation.
 
- [ ] transfect 6 of those plates 
- ### 6-29-22: cells were passaged onto 6 six well plate and one 10 mL plate from p3 to p4. 0.5 mL of cells were plated on to a 10 mL plate for cell line maintanence and 250K cells into each of the six well one. Cell live count was 0.52E6 cells/mL, leading to the addition of 3.125 mL of solution of 10 mL of P/S free media, and 2 mL of that was added to each well. Cells were checked the next day where they were transfected. 

- ### Ingredients 
| plasmid | conc [ng/ul] | needed amount = 2000/conc |
| ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| pFC9 |  |  |
| pFC19 |  |  |
| pFC30 |  |  |
| pFC61 |  |  |
| pFC66 |  |  |
| GFP |  |  |

### Steps: 
- Cells should be grown in P/S free media to get best transfection
- Get two sets of 1.5 mL tubes, one for each plasmid and put 250 uL OptiMEM into it. 
- Add 1 mL: 10 mL of plate media of lipofectamine to one set of tubes, and 2k ng of plasmid to the other. Adjust OptiMEM amount in previous step in order to keep the total fluid added to the dishes to be no more than 0.5 mL 
- mix OptiMEM and ingredents 20x times and then incubate at RT for 5 min
- mix the tubes together and mix another 20x times (spin down if needed). Let rest at RT for 20 min 
- add mixture dropwise to the plates and incubate for 24 hours 

- [ ] Hirt harvest the DNA from those cells 
- [ ] SMRF sequencing
