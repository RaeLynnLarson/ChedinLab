### 8/15 Cells have been transfected on friday and allowed to sit in tranfection solution over the weekend. When I looked at them under the GFP microscope, I saw plently of colony growth on both plates. Pics below. No notable differnece in GFP expression between the GFP colony and the non-GFP colony. Non-transfected cells were not observed. 
-Cell had 2 ml of a 1:1000 hygromycin:DMEM mixture pipetted onto them after a saline wash. Cell cultures where very confluent, so hopefully I am on their ass for the rest of the experiment.

### 8/17 Cells have been split and moved (From p6 to p7!!!!!) from their six well dish into 10 mL dishes for Hirt harvesting. Media has been exchanged for full DMEM media, and cells were observed under a microscope in every dish. Before splitting, cells were photographed. Below shows one colony of pFC9 and both dishes of GFP. Only one dish was needed in order to start the next cell line. I will check on them probably friday. ![081722HEK29c18GFPI](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/102187801/185257152-da198121-5a5b-47ec-b6ad-b90042ed6836.jpg)
