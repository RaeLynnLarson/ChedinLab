# Background 
## EBV is a viral vector that can get into and replicate in mammalian cells. We will be using it to transfect a number of cells with R-loop prone plasmids an see how, and where they form R loops 
## R-loops can get into chromatin and make R-loops as long as it is in the correct orientation (Chedin. 2012). 
## We are going to use HEKI 293c18 cells. These are resistant to both Amp and Hygromycin and so we will use 200 ng/ml hydromycin buffer to grow out cells in 
## After cells are transfected with plasmids, will will use Hirt Harvetro to harvest DNA 
## After that, SMRF seq can be used to determine location of R-loops
